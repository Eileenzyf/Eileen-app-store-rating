These aren't smoothed PNG or GIF images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. 

Whether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial NEXRAD weather radar on your iOS device and Apple Watch.

When there are any Tornado Warnings (outlined in RED), Severe Thunderstorm Warnings (YELLOW polygons), or Flash Flood Warnings (GREEN polygons) in effect throughout the US, tap the warning button in the top right corner to browse the list of current warnings, view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map. 

Pinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars.

Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. 

Meanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). 

You can display data from NOAA's public access web site, our optional WDT feed (the default), or your AllisonHouse subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.

The RadarScope Pro subscription is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from. Super-res products are still available to all RadarScope users without purchasing a subscription.

RadarScope Pro Tier 1 provides access to real-time lightning data that animates along with the radar loop and up to 20 frames of radar data, including *extended loops* of Super-Res Level 2 data. Tier 1 subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.

RadarScope Pro Tier 2 combines all the features in Tier 1 with more advanced features, including a 30-day archive of all radar products, estimated hail size contours, rotation (azimuthal shear) contours, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.

Disclaimer: Period Tracker period and fertility forecasts may not be accurate and should not be used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period. Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app. Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month.

Do you have trouble going to sleep?  Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap?  Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night?  There are numerous benefits to using White Noise:

The meerkats, small mammals living in a highly socially developed organization, live in small colonies.
Each adult, male or female, takes on the role of watchman to ensure the safety of the group.
Once adult, young dominant females and males create their own colony.

In analogy to this behavior, the users of Avertinoo choose to be called meerkats.

Near 900.000 copies of Avertinoo have been sold , proof of it's lasting quality, seriousness and confidence from it's users.

APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

Avertinoo uses a regularly updated database containing well over 27.000 radars in Europe, updated and corrected by it users.


LIMITATIONS AND USAGE

Radar notifiers are illegal in following countries : Switzerland, Germany and Austria. 

Avertinoo can legally be used in the following countries (at the moment of this publication)

France
United Kingdom
Belgium
The Netherlands
Spain
Portugal
Sweden


Avertinoo's interface shows you at any time the precise number of meerkats that used the road you're driving and since when. It shows you as well the number of people driving behind you on the road you used and that depend on your vigilance.
When an opener sends an alert, you will be visually informed in real time by waves around the number of openers
You will be informed regarding the density of speed traps around you, localized in details on a roadmap.
The number of meerkats in the same area will be available, not individually localized for confidentiality reasons.
You can choose to include the number of Meerkats coming your way, since they can alert you regarding dangers on your road ahead. If you activate the feature, their number will be shown separately just above the geek zone (green text)
Each event submitter can delete his own alerts via the inbuilt map.

Road names are now shown when possible. This feature has been improved since it release.

In your online member's section you can choose the surveillance zone(30 km default) and your sync time.

The Ipod function allows you to choose your music libraries and/or podcasts.

Next to a night mode to avoid glare and an extra option to disable the flash during warnings, you can now choose between a spoken text or signal when speeding in a zone with speed limitation.

But above all on general demand we have included a new warning regarding red light camera's. When enabled in the preferences you will be warned at maximum 500 m from the camera, a distance better suited for urban regions.

Also new is the possibility to cancel any warning with a single sweep on the screen. You can concentrate on driving instead on the warning.

Last new feature is a better management of risk areas by the server. Each time you enter a risk area, you will be asked if there is an actif speed control via the cross (no) and wink symbol (yes). If you answer yes, the zone will instantly be changed into a mobile control area for a time statistically determined by the server.

Unchanged since previous version :

-Activation with a valid email
-Choice between several audible alarms, even a voice
-Choice between several backgrounds
-Limited data usage and the option to avoid roaming
-According system language, Avertinoo will be in French, English, Dutch or Spanish 
-and ... a biker mode, economic with screen dimming option.

Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life"

----------------------------------
Featured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart™ is considered the most infamous app of all time. 

Also seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!
----------------------------------

iFart™ took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! 

We can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.

To celebrate the 7th anniversary of that incredible moment in flatulence history, iFart scientists completely rebuilt the backend of the app and released our biggest update ever!

Here are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart™.

* SECURITY FART *

Phones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.

And when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but ""it wasn't me"" isn't going to work with iFart.

Call the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.

* SNEAK ATTACK *

The sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.

Sneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.

* RECORD-A-FART *

There are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. 

The birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.

Using iFart’s “Record-A-Fart” feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.

* FART NOW *

The World Today is a very stressful place. Stress causes medical problems, eating disorders, drug addiction, and leads to divorce and broken homes.

If only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.

Well Folks... there is.. and it's FART NOW. 

Simply scroll to your preferred sound effect and hit Fart Now. The World will be a better place with more farting in it.

* BONUS FART PACKS*

iFart includes SEVEN of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.

* Shart Toppers   - The Biggest Music Parody Rips of 2015

* Presidential -  Bernie, Hillary, Ted & Donald let em rip!

* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.

* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.

""With the Star Walk app, if you hold your iPod up towards the sky, you can see all the stars and constellations. It even tells you the names of all the planets. Then, if you point it towards the ground, it shows you what all the stars are in the other hemisphere. It’s brilliant, and if you’re ever somewhere with a clear sky and  no light pollution, it’s a revelation. It’s beautifully designed and makes clever use of the available technology. I’m fascinated by astronomy, but even if you’re not, give this a go.""

You love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.

Or, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!

You carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?

Enter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.

FEATURES

 - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.

74,50155520,1.99,3393,77,4,4,4+,Education,43,5,1,"Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. 

Inside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.

Work with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find a new animal animation, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  

Multiple Language Features:

We started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say ""wabbit"" and ""wooster."" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the language of Peekaboo Barn!

Press the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.

—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.
—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, and UK English. 
—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)

FEATURED BY APPLE 
One of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over half a million times, and played over 70 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.

Peekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! 

If you are looking for more Peekaboo Barn, check out our awesome sequels: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Sesame Street, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild. 

If your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to sleep.

*******
Wind Meter 5.0 - Supports iPhone 4 and 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS8.  
Note: You must grant access to your microphone under Settings > Privacy for the application to work properly.  

****** A TOP ""20"" PAID WEATHER APPLICATION FOR 24 MONTHS STRAIGHT******     

THE ORIGINAL WIND METER APP DESIGNED TO MEASURE WIND SPEED DIRECTLY ON YOUR PHONE
   
No CELL TOWER or signal is necessary!  Wind Meter works by measuring the volume of wind flowing over your iPhone microphone and converting it into an effective wind speed reading in REAL TIME at your location!      
                                       
As quoted by: KITELIFE MAGAZINE -

""In our own field tests here at KITELIFE, we found that in a relatively consistent wind speed of 3-28 mph, the Wind Meter app was surprisingly accurate.""

As quoted by: BLUE WATER SAILING MAGAZINE - 
 
""We were really jazzed to see this new wind speed app for the iPhone and downloaded it right away. It is really cool and will be appreciated by sailors everywhere.""

As quoted by: PANBO MARINE ELECTRONICS -  

""Would you believe it? -- it actually works.  I was out testing and photographing the NMEA 2000 wind rig early this morning and thus could compare Wind Meter to a consensus of five high quality sensors mounted just a few feet over my head"".   
Ben Ellison - PANBO MARINE ELECTRONICS

As quoted by: ROBERT JOHNSON MEN'S MID-d & DISTANCE COACH, CORNELL UNIVERSITY CO-FOUNDER, LETSRUN.COM - 

""As a Division 1 Track Coach and operator of LetsRun.com, I was stunned to learn that the iphone could measure wind speed. This app works as advertised and is a lot of fun to take to a track meet.""    Robert Johnson - CORNELL UNIVERSITY

OTHER REAL WORLD USERS:

“Was at Seaside on the weekend and a guy had the app. We put it up next to a wind meter and was only off from the wind meter by 1 mph--pretty impressed.”
Reference: http://forums.ikitesurf.com/viewtopic.php?t=12643

“Works real good; pretty accurate side by side with other handheld meters. seems to have better averaging [as compared with skywatch]”
Reference: http://forums.iwindsurf.com/viewtopic.php?p=102262

""First Test Proved it For Me, Very clever app!  By chance it's blowing tonight, so I went up to our flat roof and stood a few feet below our Davis instruments anemometer. The Davis recorded a max gust of about 26 mph while the max I recorded with the Wind Meter was 23 mph. Had I climbed a ladder, I expect the readings would have been even closer.""

OPERATOR'S MANUAL:

When you open the Wind Meter APP the screen will rotate so that the microphone end of the phone will now be on top. To obtain the best wind speed readings, simply hold the iphone upright and straight out to your side with the screen facing you, letting the wind slip over the top of the phone, and push Get Wind!  Wait at least 5-10 seconds and then push Got Wind!  The final reading is the average for the period. The Wind Meter estimates wind speeds from 4-28 mph.   We recommend that you test the Wind Meter for your particular iPhone or type of use, using only natural wind and a commercial grade anemometer for comparisons. While the default calibration is appropriate for many phones, if your iOS device appears to over or under measure, you can easily calibrate your phone's Wind Meter Application by pushing the Calibrate button.  Due to the necessary installation of a noise dampener, the Wind Meter is most effective in consistent winds. For the same reason, it begins to effectively estimate wind speeds that are above 5mph.  Additionally, Wind Meter cannot measure wind speeds over 28mph (hurricane strength winds) since this equates to the max decibel level an iPhone can detect. 

This application is not intended to replace commercial grade anemometers or scientific instrumentation.
  
Wind Meter supports multiple units of measure including Miles Per Hour, Knots, Kilometers Per Hour, Beaufort, Feet Per Second, and Meters Per Second.

These frequencies can be induced in the brain by indirectly by playing two different audible binaural tones into each ear, which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible low frequency beat matching the target brainwave frequency.  As you listen, your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible binaural beat, and after a few minutes synchronize with the target brainwave frequency.  Brain Wave's 32 included programs layer these tones and binaural beat sequences into multi-stage experiences to create complete Brainwave Entrainment sessions that have helped thousands of people focus and concentrate, feel positive and motivated, and sleep more soundly.

- To use Brain Wave with Spotify or an Audio Book Reader start the other app first and then ours.  To listen with a podcast, start Brain Wave first.

- Program duration is fully adjustable.  If the program has multiple Binaural Stages the individual stages will be lengthened or shortened accordingly. 

- Programs use composite Binaural Tones that stimulate multiple brainwave frequencies to create combination experiences, such as Power Nap, Exercise Motivation or a Positive Mood Boost.

- Each program goes through a progression of binaural beats, each for a specific period of time sufficient to synchronize your brainwaves with the binaural tones.  

*** Features ***

 - 32 Advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Programs to use throughout the day.

 - Multiple program durations (10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours).  You can also set your own custom duration.

 - Use the included Ambience or create a playlist of your own iTunes Music to use with each program.  Your brain will process the binaural frequencies played over these background sounds.

- Save preferred settings, including background audio, iTunes playlist, Alarm settings, and volume for each Brainwave Program.

Touch Exposure & Focus

Shooting Modes
Use the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.

Digital Zoom
Up to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.

Front Flash
How many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!

Horizon Level
Use the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.

Clarity
Clarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.

Scene Modes
Most modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.

Effects
Professional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.

Lightbox
All the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.

Sharing
Whether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.

iCloud Lightbox sync
Automatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. 

Crops
If you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.

Borders
With Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.

The perfect egg timer with the incredible egg spy: from now on your eggs will be perfect.

Are you tired of eggs that are always too soft or to hard?
No matter where you are or how big your egg is - the perfect egg timer for perfect eggs is the solution!

The perfect egg-timer is based on scientific proof and because every egg is different, the timer calculates  the exact cooking time  based on egg size, altitude and temperature.

Usage: In order to measure the exact size of your egg, simply place it on your iPhone and set the size using your fingertip for. Determine your current altitude (or let it be determined by GPS), tell your iPhone if you kept your eggs  in the freezer or at room temperature and how you would like to have your eggs – soft-boiled, hard-boiled or something in-between.

Place your eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Add enough cold water to just cover the eggs. Bring them to a rapid boil over high heat and start the countdown. The iPhone will signal when the eggs are done. The attraction: The egg spy lets you see the changes inside your boiling egg!

Features:

-the formula for the perfect egg-timer is based on physical experiments and studies

- Egg-size can be adjusted to the nearest millimetre (inch): Simply place the egg on the iPhone scale and set the size with your fingertip.  It doesn’t get any more accurate than this. 

- Automatic change of measurement units between inch or millimeter and fahrenheit or celsisu, depending on language and international settings.

- determine and enter your altitude manually or let it be determined by GPS automatically.
- The egg-spy shows you the inside of your egg during the cooking progress"

Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.

- What People Are Saying:
""I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.""

""My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.""


Four great games to develop your skills:

- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters
The uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.

- Letter Identification to test knowledge
Multiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.

- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters
The top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.

- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting
Each letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! 

Special Features:
- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch

""Catan"", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.

True to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.

The game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:
Various computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...

The popular Catan expansions ""Seafarers"", ""Cities and Knights"" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.

The complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!

The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.

Exciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios ""Enchanted Land"" and ""The Great Canal"". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.

Features:

- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese
- Original ""Settlers of Catan"" rule set
- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games
- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies
- Scrollable game board including zoom option 
- Freely combinable game settings 
- Game statistics
- Comprehensive tutorial
- Seafarers LITE: New scenario ""The 4 Islands"" and two additional game variants
- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”
- 3 different graphic sets to choose from


***** 
Catan FAQ: 

Question: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? 
Answer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. 

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? 
Answer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. 

Question: Are dice rolls really random? 
Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!

It’s immensely replayable, thanks to over 575 interactive scenes and two objectives. Short episodes and automatic saving mean you can play even when you only have a minute or two. The built-in saga writes down the story for you. And advisors with distinctive personalities help you track your cows.

The gorgeous hand-painted artwork won Best Visual Arts at the second Independent Games Festival.

• Everything in the game is utterly convincing and even years after release, the possibilities seem endless. (One of the 5 best strategy games ever made) [Rock, Paper, Shotgun]
• It's like they took the best parts of Civilization games and combined them with the best part of Choose Your Own Adventure style game books. … What I like most about King of Dragon Pass is the seemingly infinite possibilities that the game has. … I can't get enough of King of Dragon Pass. [Touch Arcade]
• A wholly unique adventure that has no equal on the iPhone. [Pocket Gamer]
• An interactive story with a level of complexity and brilliance that's rarely seen in video games. [Gamezebo]

Players say:
• I am really happy to have found this game. It scratches so many itches: simulator, rpg, adventure book...Great work! I find myself playing it on both my iPad and iPhone. Very addictive!
• I got this game at 6pm tonight. It's now 4am, and I've hardly scratched the surface of the depth of this game. 
• I now have a fun, engaging, thought provoking RPG on my iPhone, an RPG that fits in my purse and that I can play any time I want, not having to have my computer or Xbox 360 near me to do so. 
• If Bioware remade Civilization they'd be lucky to end up half as good as King of Dragon Pass.
• It's impossible to describe the emotional tug you feel when an old and trusted advisor, who you've watched grow from a young upstart, dies of old age. Or when an exploration team disappears into the wilds, never to be heard from again. Or when a cursed clansman, shunned by his peers, sacrifices himself to stop a raid. This game will never leave my iPhone. That's the only accolade possible.

The game is completely accessible via VoiceOver.

The Plane Finder app launched in 2009 and was the first live flight tracking app - today there are millions of happy users all over the world. Plane Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 12,000+ planes simultaneously.

Search by flight number, place name, airport, airline and aircraft or browse the map.  (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).

Simply tap a plane to see detailed flight and aircraft information including photographs or tap an airport to see live arrivals and departures boards.

Use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify planes overhead using your device camera. 

23 different plane markers are included and airline logos are displayed next to planes for easy identification.

Custom alerts are unlimited and free to use, so you can take a break from watching the air traffic and let the app notify you when a plane is in the air or nearby.

Powerful and unlimited custom filters are also free to use. You can create, save and name as many filters as you need for quick access to the planes you are interested in.

Add and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or airports of interest. Handoff is supported too!

If you prefer a list view of planes to the map view, use the sortable List View. You can also rearrange the table columns for ease of use.

Watch your previous flights - all the way back to April 2011! Use playback to replay holiday flights, diversions, major incidents etc. You can also easily see the effects of storms, ATC strikes, volcanic ash clouds and more. Or just relax and use playback to view the flow of air traffic through the day.

FAA US and NATS UK aviation charts are available as an in app purchase as a visual alternative to standard maps.

Plane Finder has been featured by Gizmodo, CNN, GMA, BBC, Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, CNET, Wired, GQ Magazine and many more. We have millions of happy users and Plane Finder is regularly updated with innovative new features. Our support team always listen to and reply to feedback.

At a glance our worldwide coverage includes - 

• Europe 95% - realtime 
• North America – 100% via slightly US delayed data – Nationwide realtime ADS-B network in place and capturing 95% of ADS-B equipped aircraft 
• Rest of World – Excellent coverage in Australia, New Zealand, Central America, Brazil, Japan, Taiwan, Dubai, India, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Maldives, Mauritius, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more countries 

Important Note: 
Plane Finder works by picking up real time ADS-B and MLAT signals used by aircraft to transmit positional data to land based receivers. This technology is faster than traditional radar and is used for air traffic control and navigation. ADS-B is not used by all airlines or aircraft, however this is changing and the number of aircraft tracked by ADS-B is increasing all of the time. Traditional radar type data in real time is also included for North America.

Disclaimer: The use of the information presented using Plane Finder is strictly limited to pursuing enthusiast activities (i.e. for entertainment purposes), which specifically exclude any activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.
Under no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement."

TeachMe: Kindergarten is known as TeachMe: Reception in the UK. 

TeachMe: Kindergarten is an educational iPhone/iPad/iPod touch app which teaches six different age appropriate subjects to Kindergarten aged children: sight words, addition, subtraction, spelling and now writing letters and numbers. Parents can select which subjects they want, set different difficulty levels, and even choose specific questions. Parents can review performance history for each subject to check how their child is doing. 

TeachMe: Kindergarten keeps children engaged with a rather unique reward system where children earn a coin for every three correct answers. Coins can then be used to purchase stickers to place in fun sticker scenes or to purchase items for the new virtual aquarium. Sticker scenes can be exported as wallpaper or emailed to family and friends. 

The simple and intuitive user interface is designed to be child friendly, which allows children to play without help from an adult. An animated teacher (Mimi Mouse) gives verbal instructions and feedback to the child which makes learning fun. 

FEATURES: 
• Virtual Aquarium reward (4 types of fish and 40+ items) 
• 6 different sticker reward scenes: farm, beach, underwater reef, pirate cove, city, playground 
• Over 150 different stickers for adding to scenes 
• Save learning information for up to 40 students 
• Select which subjects are displayed for each student 
• Turn on/off specific questions within a subject 
• Change the number of correct questions to earn a reward 
• Change the number of questions in a row to mark a question learned 
• Tracks performance for each subject item (last five) 
• Export sticker rewards scenes to Photos, for emailing or using as wallpaper 

LEARNING SUBJECTS: 
• Sight Words: Dolch (Pre-K), Dolch (K) 
• Addition: up to a total of 10 
• Subtraction: from 10 down 
• Spelling: complete words by choosing the missing letter 
• Letter Writing: how to write letters a-z, A-Z
• Number Writing: how to write numbers 0-9.

The best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and support for phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.

Now with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.

First Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:

** Animals **
** Vehicles **
** Colors **
** Shapes **
** Words from around the house **

(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)

A wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.

If your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!

Here's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: 

“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” 
-- Fun Educational Apps 

“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” 
-- iTunes Review 

“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” 
--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime 

“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” 
--Common Sense Media 

“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” 
--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u 

""First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'"" 
---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious

Accurate touch controls and real physics makes Clay Hunt an authentic shotgun shooting experience. In five different game modes you'll have to learn to handle a shotgun like an expert and hit rapidly flying targets from varying angles! Including Arcade Challenge featuring upgrades, power-ups and unlimited gameplay.

Skeet and trap shooting enthusiast all around the world praise Clay Hunt for it's realistic physics and authenticity:

""I shoot trap on a regular basis and have been looking for a realistic clay shooting game. Look no further,this is it.""

""Best Shooting Game App Period” 

""Love this game - bought it thinking it might be fun but it's far more than that - brilliant fun - always trying to beat my previous best. Play with headphones and the shotgun sound is so accurate - just like the real thing. RECOMMENDED""

""Excellent !!!! Le top !!!!!""

""Shoot clays at the weekend have been shooting about three months with some coaching. Some targets I can hit no problem, others I just cant hit. I was looking for a clay simulator to try and analyse my mistakes. I was sure my problem was reading the targets and my searching bought me to this game.
First thing I noticed was the target presentations were all familiar to me and the ones I can shoot in the real world I can shoot in the game. Targets I cant hit for real I cant hit in the game either. So I played it for four says straight learning where to place the shot for various targets at various stages of flight. Off to the range today I shot my best round ever, and I mean massive difference. Missed some fast crossers then hit them by increasing the lead a little. It has helped me build up target pictures in my head so I take them more instinctively. 
Thanks for a truly useful app. I was going to spring for another lesson out of desperation, another £75 but Im going to stick with this for a while""

Features:
• Real life physics for clay bird trajectories and leads
• Unique multi-touch controls
• Authentic graphics and sound effects
• Tutorial mode, where you can practice your shotgun handling
• Three classic clay pigeon shooting modes (similar to skeet shooting or trap shooting)

There are three different calls to choose from:

1) NICE CALL:  Use this any time of year, when your child has done something particularly nice, and you want to reward them by making sure Santa knows just how good they've been!  Kids love it and want to do more nice things, so they can call Santa again!

2) NAUGHTY CALL:  Use this whenever your child has been naughty and you want to get them back in line by letting Santa know that they've been bad!  This really works and immediately gets kids back on track so you won't have to call Santa about them being naughty again!

3) SANTA VOICE MAIL:  Santa answers his video phone with his cheery ""outgoing message"", saying he's sorry he missed your call!  Just wait for the beep, and you and your children can tell Santa anything you want!  Simple, fast, and easy!

Title: War and Peace

Author: Leo Tolstoy

Pages: 1306

Genre: Fiction

Language: English 

Description: The novel tells the story of a number of aristocratic families and the entanglements of their personal lives with Napoleon's invasion of Russia. As events proceed, Tolstoy systematically denies his subjects any significant free choice: the onward roll of history determines happiness and tragedy alike."

A traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.

Shift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.

Entering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!

In addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. 

Shift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.

FEATURES:

- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types
- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds
- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps
- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars
- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance
- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar
- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar

313,76394496,4.99,6403,491,4.5,4.5,4+,Games,43,5,1,"Have you ever wondered what it’s like to land the Space Shuttle? Now you can find out. F-Sim Space Shuttle is a critically acclaimed flight simulator for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We’ve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.

No ads, no in-app-purchases.

Each flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown,  chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles. 

You control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.

Here’s what others have said about it:

“Because this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.”
John Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer

“I was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.”
Alex L., www.space-shuttle-mission.com

“Absolutely awesome app that is a must for shuttle huggers and aspiring astronauts.”
Chris Bergin, Managing Editor, NASASpaceflight.com

F-Sim Space Shuttle takes full advantage of modern iOS devices, but also runs smoothly on older hardware. We’ve tested it on all iOS devices, and iOS versions 3 to 7."

Rendered in full color 3D, Coaster Extreme offers diverse, dramatic landscapes, wild track colors, and user controls. Viewable as a VR stereographic image (glasses not needed), the high resolution visuals are stunning, and options including Afterburners and left/right panning boost the experience. Buckle Up!

This Cross-Eyed stereographic animation is simply viewed by relaxing your eyes and focusing deep within the display, which will come to life in full 3D, just like you were actually there. Be mesmerized by a smooth ride on the roller coaster which appears to go deep into your display.

No glasses are required, the display happens to be a nice size to view these effects and you will be amazed. When viewed correctly, you will see three images, with the center one in stereographic, then just watch and enjoy.

A normal 3D view and a viewport view with top and side views are also available, just touch the Info button and select the mode.

Warning! The intense immersive coaster ride feels so real you may feel dizzy or nauseous, Enjoy! 

Highlighted Features:
Dynamically created endless roller coaster, the track never ends.
High performance OpenGL ES rendering.
Realistic rendered scenery with dramatic textures and skys.
Dramatic lighting effects for track and landscapes.

Google Cardboard support.
View-Master VR support.

Hints from testers for viewing the 3D stereographic effects:

- Try putting the screen right next to your nose, and cross your eyes a little until you see one blurry display, then while retaining focus on that image, slowly move the display away until you reach about 12 inches. The optimal distance is dependent on your eyes and ability to focus. When correct, the center display should be clear.

- Another method is to hold the display about 12 inches from your eyes, and hold your hand perpendicular to your display about half way between your eyes and the display. Move your hand closer or farther from the display until with each eye closed you only see one of the images. Then when both eyes are open, you should find it easier to focus within the display. Once you have focused on the display, you should be able to remove your hand.

- In general, you need to relax your eyes and focus within the display in order to see the effects.

- Last, some of the population has difficulty focusing on Stereographic targets, however most testers have been able to enjoy stereographic effects with practice.

Initially released in Japan in 1987, the original FINAL FANTASY amazed audiences with its rich story and stunning graphics.

Players guide the Warriors of Light as they set out on a quest to restore the crystals to their former luster. Its side-view battles, choice and promotion of character classes, and sprawling world explored with fantastic vehicles quickly became standards of the series. This game set the stage for all FINAL FANTASY games to come.

This release also contains the bonus dungeons added to later editions of the game--the Soul of Chaos and the Labyrinth of Time.

FINAL FANTASY II is highly anticipated follow-up to the original FINAL FANTASY, released in Japan in 1988.

The game features the bitter and beautiful tale of four war-orphaned heroes who become embroiled in a conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance. By eschewing conventional leveling for a proficiency system that allows players to tailor their characters' growth and incorporating a key term memory system that makes dialogue integral to gameplay, this game sparked the spirit of innovation for which the series has become known.

This release also contains the bonus dungeons added to later editions of the game--the Soul of Rebirth and the Arcane Labyrinth.

How many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.
 
Slow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:
 
MOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.

LIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!

LOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!

Highlights:

•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO
•  Option to resume capture 
•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time
•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls
•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure
•  Time-lapse Intervalometer
•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer

The essential Watermarking App for Professionals, Business and Personal Use. Easily, secure and protect your photos with a text, graphic, signature or QR watermark.

Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.

""It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.""
- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com

Why Watermark?

Digitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.

- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.
- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.
- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.
- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.
- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.
- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.

Q:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? 
A:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.

Q:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?
A:Yes

See the manual for more details:
http://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/

IMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.

Ship Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.

Our incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!
Simply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.
Powerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).

Add and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.

You can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. 

Ship Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.

Ship Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.

Our global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.

Pinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help.

""With the Star Walk app, if you hold your iPod up towards the sky, you can see all the stars and constellations. It even tells you the names of all the planets. Then, if you point it towards the ground, it shows you what all the stars are in the other hemisphere. It’s brilliant, and if you’re ever somewhere with a clear sky and  no light pollution, it’s a revelation. It’s beautifully designed and makes clever use of the available technology. I’m fascinated by astronomy, but even if you’re not, give this a go.""

--- Instructions How to Play and Win Math Bingo---

The object of Math Bingo is to get a pattern of five Bingo Bugs in a row by correctly answering math problems. Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. 

Scoring
The score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. 

Example:
Time to complete game 0:45 seconds
Incorrect answers: 3
Score: 45+6=51 

Player Profiles
Math Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. 

Selecting a Game
There are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. 

Bingo Bugs 
Bingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! 

Settings
The settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles.

________________________________
To the classic Sudoku, we added:

=> Thanks to Game Center, you can now rank and compare Sudoku scores and achievements against friends and strangers

=> ▻Sudoku also counts the runs, that is, each uninterrupted sequence of games won, and adds them to the online leaderboards 
________________________________
In ▻Sudoku, you win a game when you solve a puzzle with 3 errors or less (we used this threshold to give a bit of slack for mis-tapping :) Also, you have a number of hints to help you play (more at the easy, less at the hard level). To fit any taste, you can choose between a lush tile look or a more classic board look :) 
________________________________ 
You gain access to medium level after you win the easy level 2 times consecutively, same for hard level (3 times)

Three types of game play make sure you really know your stuff and never get bored.  
 
In the multiple-choice round, answers come from a library of more than 1300 National Geographic Bee questions.  In the map challenge round, you zoom, pinch and tap your way to find spots on an interactive map from a catalog of 1000+ locations.  For an added challenge, bonus rounds include compelling National Geographic photographs where you have to locate what's in the photo on the interactive map...only we don't tell you where the photo was taken or what is in the picture!
 
The faster you answer, the more points you get! You have to keep up the pace to move on to the next round.

About National Geographic Bee:
Each year thousands of schools in the United States participate in the National Geographic Bee using materials prepared by the National Geographic Society. The contest is designed to encourage teachers to include geography in their classrooms, spark student interest in the subject, and increase public awareness about geography. Schools with students in grades four through eight are eligible for this entertaining and challenging test of geographic knowledge.

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.

AnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:

- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.
- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.
- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.
- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.
- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.
- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.
- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.
- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.

Please note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, making changes to the appearance of cards and turning on options like 'type in the answer' currently needs to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.

Aside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.

Like all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http://www.apple.com/itunes/education/

For more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html

If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicle’s grip. A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. 

It’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. 

Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better! 
____________________________________ 

HOW TO PLAY 
Drifting is a very unique Motorsport where points are allocated on 4 main criteria: Speed, Line, Angle and Impact. 

LINE: Drift within pre-designated zones to get extra points. The line is marked by several clipping zones where the driver must get as close as possible while sideways to increase score. 

ANGLE: The more the better. Drift with style and try to get your car as sideways as possible without wiping out to gain more points. 

SPEED: Always try to drift as fast as possible while staying in control. If you hit a wall or get off-track, you will lose your current combo score. If you complete the race quickly, you will gain additional points. 

IMPACT: This is the show factor! It’s about entertaining the crowd and delivering an exciting performance. Make them cheer; everyone enjoys the smell of burning rubber.

Enter the Darwinian world of a galactic mote. To survive, absorb smaller organisms and grow—but beware of larger predators. Osmos features unique physics-based play, stellar graphics, and a hypnotic ambient soundtrack. Absorb or be absorbed!

“The ultimate ambient experience” — Gizmodo
“The best iPad game yet.” — IGN

THE CRUX:
you must grow by absorbing smaller motes, but to propel yourself you must eject matter behind you, causing you to shrink. From this delicate balance, Osmos leads the player through floating playgrounds, competitive petri dishes, deep solar systems, and more. 

“Named as iPad Game of the Year for a reason, Osmos is a fantastic game. A combination of physics, survival and classic eat em up” — WeDoCode
“Whether you're a child at heart who likes mucking about with single-cell organisms, or a strategist with a physics degree, this game will appeal to everyone.” — App Store review

 * Multiplayer! (more info below.)
 * Endless replay value: play random versions of any level in Arcade mode.
 * Award-winning electronic soundtrack by Loscil, Gas, High Skies, Biosphere, Julien Neto, and more.
 * Seamlesss multitouch controls: swipe to warp time, tap anywhere to eject mass, pinch to zoom…
 * Time-warping: slow down the flow of time to outmaneuver agile opponents; speed it up to raise the challenge.
 * Confront four distinct AI opponents: the Ovarium, the Biophobe, the Nemocyte… and the deadly Ferax.
 * 13 single-player and 15 multiplayer achievements.
 * Progress synced via iCloud.

MULTIPLAYER

“a beautiful, absorbing experience."" — IGN

“What iPad Gaming Should Be All About” — Gizmodo 

5/5 - Macworld Editor’s Choice - “One of the best games we’ve played so far this year. An utterly serene, yet fiendishly complicated game that deserves a place in every iPad owners collection.” — MacWorld 

4/4, Must Have - “We are more than overwhelmed by Osmos for iPad… The game design is thoughtful and intuitive, new level structures are flawless, and the visuals are stunning yet simplistic… every iPad owner should have Osmos on their device. You just won’t find another experience quite like it.” — Slide To Play 

“Osmos HD is THE game for the iPad.” — Pocket Lint 

“It’s the best iPad game on the App Store” — MTV Multiplayer

“The first proper breakout hit for the iPad. Osmos feels so natural and enjoyable to play, even when the difficulty ramps up and you find yourself repeatedly careening into a giant gaseous enemy.” — Wired

5/5 - “Osmos is an absolute must that will change the way you think of games, and what you expect from them.” — AppAdvice

“Beyond doubt, a work of genius... a relaxing, meditative experience about going with the flow... It all adds up to something otherworldly and just . . . incredible.” — GameAndPlayer.net"

The game is just having trouble reading an old saved file. Simply delete the game from your device and re-download and everything should be a-ok! **

Grandpa always was a little eccentric. A fantastic engineer, he was always buried in his work, always coming up with new ideas and inventions that as a child held you wide-eyed in awe.

Now, after many years, you return to the house that holds so many fond memories for you, with a promise from Grandpa to show you something truly amazing. You can't even begin to imagine what it could be!

It's a dark and stormy night as you arrive at Grisly Manor. The rain beats down hard, lightning flashes in the sky as the sound of thunder fills your ears. You already feel a little creeped out, but when you make your way inside, the house is curiously empty. Grandpa is nowhere to be found!
 
But his presence is everywhere.

Familiar objects have been re-engineered to create puzzles for you. Clues abound, and as each puzzle is solved, the solution to others present themselves. As well as new puzzles, of course.

Grandpa obviously spent a lot of time making sure that nobody could solve the myriad of puzzles strewn about the house. Nobody but you, his favorite grandchild...

Can you solve the mystery of Grisly Manor?

Features: 
• Beautiful hand-painted graphics that draw you into this mesmerizing adventure! 
• Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve!

It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and compare your score with the average of other participants. 

IQ, which stands for intelligence quotient, is a general estimate of the capacity of individuals to think and reason. Prepared by a certified psychologist, this IQ test gives a standardized quantitative score of your abstract intelligence. The result you will obtain is only a simple index of your intellectual alertness: it cannot qualify your level of intelligence on its own. 

During the IQ test, you cannot use a calculator, but a sheet of paper and a pencil are allowed. You must answer all questions, and if you do not have a sure answer, you are advised to follow your intuition. Finally, if you think a question has multiple answers, you must select the one that seems most obvious and most reasonable.

""I had some fun with it (and that was my primary goal when I decided to take it). However since English is not my main language (I'm Portuguese) I had some difficulties in understanding a few questions. In most cases I would attribute them to the idiom factor. But from what I know of myself I would say that the strengths pointed out by the test make a lot of sense and grasp quite well my greatest capabilities."" - Tiago Bento (Portugal)"

يعتبره أكثر من 20 مليون مسلم في أنحاء العالم الإسلامي التطبيق الأكثر دقة لمواعيد الصلاة والأذان. كما يحتوي Muslim Pro أيضًا على القرآن بالكامل بالنصوص العربية والعلامات الصوتية والترجمات والتلاوات المسموعة إلى جانب محدد موقع القبلة وتقويم هجري إسلامي وخريطة لمطاعم الأكل الحلال والمساجد وما إلى ذلك.

ملاحظات مهمة

(1) إذا كنت تعتقد أن التطبيق يعطيك أوقات صلاة خاطئة، فمن المرجح أن هذا الأمر يعود إلى الإعدادات التي وضعتها. يُعتبر تمكين الإعدادات التلقائية الطريققة الأسلم للحصول على أوقات الصلاة الأدق في معظم الحالات

(2) لا يمكننا الرد على الآراء المنشورة على موقع متجر التطبيقات. إذا وجدت خطأ أو احتجت إلى مساعدتنا، يرجى الكتابة إلينا (من التطبيق نفسه) أو على الشبكات الاجتماعية أدناه.

A unique combination of features makes Pocket Anatomy the superior Anatomy and Physiology product in the market place: 

1. INTUITIVE SEARCH
Confusion is easy when it comes to anatomy terms. With our intuitive search option it will suffice to type in only the first characters of the word you are looking for, or one of the words composing the main term. E.g. if you type in “trap” you will get “trapezoid” as well as “coracoclavicular-trapezoid ligament”. The more letters you type the more refined the search.

2. INTUITIVE NAVIGATION
Fly around the human body swiping your finger on the screen, fluidly navigating from the skin layer through the superficial to deep musculature, and on through to internal organ structures, ligaments and the skeletal system.

3. RICH CONTENT
Pocket Anatomy now includes full 3D male and female anatomy as well as detailed stand alone visual information on circulatory, connective tissue, digestive, integumentary, lymphatic, muscular, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal and urinary systems.

4. CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Anatomical structures in each layer are pinned for identification. Each pin is associated with additional concise relevant information and clinical notes.

5. GREAT STUDY TOOL
Studying for your next Anatomy and Physiology exam? Add your notes next to a pin, bookmark the content you are interested in and retrieve it every time you need it. Test your knowledge with your classmates or challenge yourself with our quizzes. 

6. YOU’RE IN GOOD COMPANY

514,40472576,4.99,76,2,4,1,4+,Education,37,5,5,"Video Physics brings automated object tracking and video analysis to iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Capture video of an object in motion, then tap to track automatically. Video Physics instantly creates trajectory, position, and velocity graphs for the object.

Video Physics is perfect for science students and instructors. Perform on-the-go analysis of interesting motion. Measure the velocity of a child's swing, a roller-coaster, or a car. Or, take a video of a basketball free throw shot. Video Physics will display the path of the ball and provide graphs of y vs. x as well as the x and y position and velocity as a function of time. 

Features of Video Physics: 
• Capture a new video using the built-in camera, choose a video from your Photo Library, or use one of our sample videos
• Track an object automatically or manually add points to the video frame
• Set the scale of the video using an object of known size
• Optionally set coordinate system location and rotation
• View graphs of trajectory and x/y position and velocity
• Export video with points
• Email the video and data for further analysis in Vernier's Logger Pro software for OS X and Windows
• Open data files directly in Vernier's Graphical Analysis app

Quotes from physics teachers: 
""Just played with new Vernier video physics app on iPhone - it ROCKS! I remember the day when this would've cost thousands of dollars to do."" Mark Hines @mhines, teacher 

""You should check out Vernier's Video Physics app. Students can email video analysis data to Logger Pro; very cool!!"" @willkomme, physics teacher 

Vernier’s Video Physics app is slick. - Ryan Bretag @ryanbretag, teacher and administrator 

App Store featured: Staff Favorite, New and Noteworthy, and What's Hot!
2012 CODiE Awards Finalist - Best Educational Use of a Mobile Device

Hints for taking useful videos: 
• Objects that are very different than their background (black/white) work best for automated tracking. It is also helpful to use a background with uniform color and shading. See our sample videos for examples.
• Do not move the camera. Analysis assumes the camera is fixed in position. 
• The object in motion should remain approximately in a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction. 
• Place an object with known dimensions, such as a meter stick, in the same plane as the motion. Use this to scale the video. 

Video Physics is intended for use in science education. The video analysis done in Video Physics provides a useful technique for studying two-dimensional kinematics. You can do even more with Vernier's Graphical Analysis app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch or with Logger Pro software for Mac OS X and Windows."

The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.

Exciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios ""Enchanted Land"" and ""The Great Canal"". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.

Catan FAQ: 

Question: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? 
Answer: Don’t worry, your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. 

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? 
Answer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter ""CatanWarp*"" (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. 

Question: Are dice rolls really random? 
Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!

________________________________________

REALISTIC PHYSICS
Real-time 3D physics simulation, authentically recreating the behavior of a real wooden Jenga tower. Each block is realistically affected by the surrounding blocks, recreating the same strategic depth as the original game.

TOUCH CONTROL
Anyone who’s played Jenga knows how delicate your touch needs to be. The iPhone’s super-accurate touch screen gives you the control you’ll need to go for world record heights (incidentally… the record is 40 2/3 layers!). Blocks can be teased out using a mix of gentle tapping and drag controls. It’s easy to begin with, but you’ll soon find it tough when the pressure is on and the tower is wobbling!

GYROSCOPE INTEGRATION
View the tower just as you would in real life by moving the device around it. The built-in gyroscopic mechanisms allow for unprecedented control of your viewpoint. Study the structure of the blocks to plan your next move.

SOCIAL GAMEPLAY
Obviously the best part of Jenga is putting off your friends as they are making their move. The four-player Pass’n’Play mode truly reproduces the nail-biting tension of the real thing… but you can play it anywhere!
And what’s more, Jenga for iPhone lets you compare your current tower height against that of friends around the world – while you play! A little friendly competition is the best motivator...

ARCADE MODE
Jenga on iPhone introduces a brand new mode: Jenga Arcade. Match colors for extra points and score multipliers by moving fast – but don’t topple the tower! While you play, you earn coins which you can spend on special boosts like collapse reverse, multipliers, and wildcards. It’s fast and frantic… totally turning Jenga on its head.

STUNNING VISUALS
Jenga for iPhone is beautiful. With full Retina display support, you won’t see a single pixel. Advanced wood shaders make the tower pop out and let you gauge its stability. And everything is set in beautiful environments, rivalling the quality of modern games consoles.

GAME CENTER INTEGRATION
Like all titles from NaturalMotion Games, Jenga fully supports Apple’s Game Center including leaderboards, achievements and easy friend comparisons.

AUTHENTICITY
Designed in consultation with Leslie Scott, the inventor of Jenga, to create the most authentic Jenga experience ever.

MosaLingua's effective and addictive teaching method will help you memorize loads of vocabulary, key phrases and conjugations in record time. Through dialogue exercises, you'll be able to improve both your English comprehension and your speaking skills at the same time.

OUR SCIENTIFIC APPROACH
MosaLingua was designed by an English professor and a team of polyglots and developers who actually use MosaLingua on a daily basis.
Be sure to check out the video demo at http://mosalingua.com

Learn the essential 20% that will apply 80% of the time. Afterwards, you can choose the most relevant area of focus for your interests (travel, sports, business, technology...).
Did you know that you can get by just fine on vacation knowing less than 500 carefully-chosen words?  By spending just 10 minutes per day for two months, you’ll be able to memorize 600 words and key phrases! Our app contains over 3000 vocabulary words, ranging in difficulty from “hello” (level 0) to “silk” (level 10).

If you are a beginner or you already know the basics, MosaLingua will adapt to suit your needs. It's like having your own private tutor in your pocket!
Whether your motivation for learning English is for school (diploma, classes, TOEFL, TOEIC), vacation, business, or simply for the joy of learning, MosaLingua will have you speaking English in no time.

MOSALINGUA CONSISTS OF:
► 3000+ flashcards of vocabulary and phrases, including audio pronunciation by native English speakers
► 14 diverse categories (e.g. the basics, transportation, shopping, tourism, social,...)
► More than 100 sub-categories (e.g. At a restaurant, at a hotel, buying and negotiating, sports, partying, flirting...)

► Short English lessons and language tips, as well as dialogues for common situations
► Irregular verb practice
► Over 100 bonuses to unlock as you progress

HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND PROVEN LEARNING METHOD:
MosaLingua apps rely on the Spaced Repetition System (SRS), the product of several years of scientific research, which is much more effective than the Leitner method that most other language learning apps use. Learn more about this system on our website.

► Calculates optimal review sessions for flash cards according to how difficult you rate them, to encourage efficient and long-term memorization
► Doesn’t waste your time: spend time learning what you find useful, not what you already know
► MosaLingua constantly adapts to your needs and pace

""Ra is another brilliant 4.5 [out of 5] Dimple pleasure."" - AppSmile.com 

""[Ra] is very stunning and impressive! Keep up the good work!"" - Reiner Knizia 


Build an empire that will live forever. Collect tiles representing various aspects of Egyptian life and civilization while your rivals try to do the same. Wisely use the few tokens that Ra, the sun god, has given you to earn your place of honor in the Valley of the Kings. 

Combining deep strategy with an intuitive and beautiful visual presentation, Ra captures the mysterious lure of Ancient Egypt and will bring you back for more time and time again. Choose your favorite of 8 different Egyptian gods as your avatar, and then discover the true power of the gods as you compete against them in solo play. 

With no setup time required, no pieces to lose, and no arguments about the rules, the future of board games is here and Ra gives you exactly what you want -- to play! 

How to play:

Tap the draw button to reveal a single tile. The player with the highest sun (token from Ra) begins. A player without tokens takes no action on their turn. When an epoch ends, players receive or lose fame points depending on the tiles they hold. The player with the most fame after three epochs is the winner.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with CLIPish, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  See http://clipish.net/support.

* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the server communication, CLIPish works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.

* FAMILIES:  This app accesses Internet content, but filters out adult material.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict or get the Family Edition.

* ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK:  You can send all the items found in CLIPish to Facebook, HOWEVER, Facebook converts all animations to still images, as Facebook does not allow animations to ""play"" on their site.

* Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.

Initially released in Japan in 1993, Secret of Mana took the world by storm with its innovative real-time battle system and gorgeously rendered world. It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.
One of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.
Play as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.

1993年8月6日,《聖劍傳說2》在超級任天堂上發售,以當時的新概念系統“動作戰鬥”博得了相當的人氣。這是一款將指令戰鬥的戰略性融入到即時、無縫戰鬥中的角色扮演遊戲,無論新手還是老玩家都能從中體驗到充分的爽快感。

“指令環”是《聖劍》系列的特色系統之一。按鍵後畫面上會出現環形的選單,不需要切換畫面就可以使用道具、更換武器,是一種非常方便的系統。這一系統在《聖劍傳說2》裏首次登場,之後為整個系列所傳承。

玩家將操作主人公Randi,以及他的夥伴Primm和Popoi行動,隨著劇情的展開而前往世界各地冒險。本作劇情的關鍵,是肉眼無法看見的強大力量“瑪娜”。與覬覦瑪娜之力的帝國軍隊作戰、邂逅掌管自然之力的精靈們……在他們冒險的旅途中,將會有諸多有趣的故事在前方等待著。"

SimplePhysics lets you design complex structures for everything from tree houses to ferris wheels and then simulates your design with a sophisticated physics engine.

A wise person once said: ""An engineer is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar."" In SimplePhysics, your design must not only be strong enough, it must be cheap enough to win. 

Create your design in seconds with the blueprints editor. If you make a mistake, simply tap the Undo button. Zoom in and out by pinching the screen and pan the view using a two finger drag.

While testing, you can see how the strain is distributed across your design. Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green. This allows you to find and fix problem areas in your design. 

The finger test lets you use your finger to push and pull on your design. You can use this with pinpoint accuracy, or you can just smash your design to smithereens. The finger test has an explosive new twist. You can now create explosions by tapping the screen for ultimate annihilation.

The newly added Bomb Shack level includes a dummy with full support for ragdoll physics. Throw him around, blow him up, and smash him against your design.

The slow motion feature lets you slow things down so you can see how your design is failing, and it is also incredibly fun to watch explosions destroying your design in slow motion. 

Features
* Realistic physics simulation
* Ragdoll physics
* Slow motion mode
* Stress display shows problem areas in your design
* Wide variety of levels!
* Finger Test - smash your design to pieces, or blow it up with realistic explosions!
* Save/Load designs
* E-mail your blueprints to your friends
* Universal support for the iPad"

To celebrate our latest update, Scan is on sale for a limited time for $1.99 down from $4.99! (over 50% off!)

ABOUT SCAN

Scan is the fastest and most user-friendly QR reader and barcode scanner available. If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod came with a built-in scanner, this would be it. Here is what our reviewers are saying:

“Quick and very reliable. I’d give it six stars if it were possible.”
“No ads, beautiful design, and even caught blurry QR codes I didn’t expect it to scan”
“I’ve saved over $80 by scanning products in the store and finding them cheaper online”

HOW THE APP WORKS

To scan a QR code or barcode simply open the app, point the camera at the code, and you’re done! There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at.

When scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action.

PRODUCT BARCODES

Scan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan. Barcode scanning requires a newer iPhone or iPad in order to work reliably. Cameras on older devices do not provide the resolution or focus required for barcode scanning.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

• View a history list and map of all of your past scans
• Sync your scan history across the web and all of your devices
• Toggle your front or rear camera for scanning
• Set a default browser to open websites in
• Scan pictures of QR codes and barcodes from your camera roll
• A switch to turn on your device’s light (if it has one) for scanning in low-light circumstances

DEDICATED TO PERFECTION

Our goal is to make our app the best scanning app in the store. We can’t do this without you. We are dedicated to your satisfaction and need to hear feedback from you. If you have an issue with Scan, please do not write a review of the app saying ""it didn't work."" This does not help us make things better for you. Instead, please contact us at support@scan.me or on Twitter @scan and we'll do our best to help.

REQUIREMENTS

In order to use Scan, your device must have a built-in camera. When scanning codes that redirect to online content, such as websites, you will need Internet connectivity.

MAKE YOUR OWN QR CODES ON SCAN.ME

Want to make your own QR codes for others to scan? Visit our site at http://scan.me to create and manage your own QR codes for free.

  通勤・通学の途中の公園で見かけた花や、散歩やハイキングなどで野や山で見かけた花の名前が気になり、後で名前を調べようと思っても、なかなか探せなかったという経験はありませんか？花しらべは、そのようなときに、花の咲いているその場所で、花の名前を調べるためのアプリです。写真を撮り画像認識で花の名前を調べたり、花の大きさや花の色などの条件で検索して花の名前を調べることができます。アウトドアでみられる植物を中心に多数収録しています。名前がわかると植物に親しみやすくなり、散歩、ハイキング、登山、旅行がより楽しくなります。

-花の認識と検索はオフラインで実行していますのでSIMなし/電波の届きにく場所/海外でも使用することができます。 
-デジカメ等の外部の写真もiPhone/iPadの写真ライブラリに保存すれば花認識ができます。
-花認識を正しく行うためアプリ内の右上の説明をよくお読みになりご使用ください。

【花認識 】
カメラで写真を撮る場合、すでに撮影した写真をアルバムから選ぶ場合、ビデオモード(動画)で花認識することができます。写真を撮影(選択)後、認識する花を四角で囲むと画面下部に候補が表示されます。花の大きさ/丈/撮影月/草木/種別/生育環境などの条件を入力し詳細に調べることができます。植物の説明や画像で確認しながら花の名前を同定します。説明には、名称/学名/英名/別名/科名/原産/生育環境/花径/花序高/草丈・樹高-/花色/薬効/特徴/花言葉等が含まれています。

USAGE NOTES:

• SEARCHING for Courses: When searching for courses by name, you can just search for ""Aug"" instead of ""Augusta National Golf Course"" (leave out the quote marks).

• SEARCHING for Courses: Radar button will find Mapped courses within 25mi/40km of your current location.

• To save battery power, click your power button to turn off the screen when not in use.

• GPS accuracy can vary over time (click the GPS signal strength icon at any time to see your accuracy).

• Before playing a course preview its mapping by clicking the link for the course name at www.skydroid.net/courses.php (best done using a large screen). Let us know of any mapping issues, or make changes yourself.

• If we don’t have your course, you can add it as long as there is a satellite image of the course available in Course Mapper.

• Change distance measurement (yards/meters) in the app Settings available on the in-app Menu.

• While playing golf you will only incur data usage while using the Satellite View screen. Course downloads can be done at home over Wi-Fi and are small in size.

Grandma was right.

Nobody really believed her. Not even you, her favorite grandchild.

But she was right. And more so than you could ever imagine.

The city before you, deep in the mist shrouded forest, can't be found on any map. It shouldn't even exist. Though it's been asleep for a long time, you feel a mysterious power begin to awaken from the ruins around you.

Legend has it the civilization that built this place could somehow control the seasons. But nobody listens to legends.

Nobody except Grandma.

And she was right.

You look again at the artifact she gave you. Close to this lost city, it almost seems alive in your hand.

The city does exist. It's real.

Could the secret magic, powerful enough to change the seasons, be real too?

• Inspired by classic point and click adventure games!
• Beautiful graphics that draw you into this mesmerizing adventure!
• Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve!
• Original soundtrack and sound effects!

• Tickle him and he will laugh out loud. 
• Poke his eyes and he will shout and yell.

Talking Carl is hours of laugh for children of any age. 
Parents, you'll love him too for the peacefulness it gives you while your kids are playing with him.

Use the hills as jumps - slide down, flap your wings and fly! At least for a moment - until this annoying gravity brings you back down to earth. But the next hill is waiting for you already. Watch out for the night and fly as fast as you can. Otherwise flying will only be a dream once again.

Tiny Wings was chosen as the iPhone Game of the Year in App Store Rewind 2011 in Europe and many other countries. Thank you Apple and a big thank you to all Tiny Wings fans!

• the world is changing every day - so it does in this game! Procedural generated graphics will make ""tiny wings"" look different every day you play
• upgrade your nest by fulfilling tasks
 • Two game modes: ""Day Trip"" and ""Flight School""
• Play as the mama bird or one of her four children
• 25 hand-designed levels in the new ""Flight School"" mode

Alerts you with sound even when the phone is lying unused with screen off!

User reviews:
""Greatest weather app I've ever used. Also this thing will wake the dead if a tornado warning is issued. It's incredible."" - DE Hallman

""This app has saved my wife's garden more than once from hail."" - rudy_z1

""I love that I get weather alerts before my weather radio goes off and I get alerts even when I'm out running around."" - loopfish

Important: When you install and launch for the first time, the app will ask to turn on push-notifications and location services. Please choose YES to avoid the hassle of having to manually enable them later. Alerts will not work without either of these.

- Browse current advisories on a map 
- Get a push-notification whenever an alert is issued within a distance you have specified. You can choose anywhere upto 3 miles only or all the way upto 100 miles. 
- Choose type/severity of events you want to receive, including Tornado warnings 
- Check the current weather + forecast for any spot on the map
- Your phone will make a siren sound when there is a Tornado Warning nearby! 
- Will automatically transition to your new location as you travel, no need to reconfigure anything.
- National UV Alert map and Radar map. 
- We have worked very hard to make the system as accurate as possible. The system will not miss an alert issued by the NWS, will not deliver a false alert, and will not deliver duplicate alerts. 
- Alerts marked as ""Severe"" or ""Urgent"" by the NWS are prioritized by the system for faster delivery to end-users.
- Even though defaults have been tested to be appropriate, you can configure maximum alert frequency to your taste, or turn them off altogether. 

Once you setup and put the app in the background, most likely you will never have to open the app again.

Note that if you have *any* question whatsoever while using the app, you can send a quick message to support from within the app, and we *will* respond very fast.

Notes:
- This app is useful for users in the US only."

 • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” 

 • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” 

 • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.

 • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” 

 • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”

698,8029184,0.99,1537,159,4.5,4,4+,Education,37,5,1,"Quotes from recent reviews:
• ""I am a teacher. I love this app! You thought of everything and put it in simple form...""

• ""As a teacher & parent, I think this is the Best Math Fact App yet. It has all 4 operations and allows you to choose exactly which #'s to drill""

• “I have purchased many math apps for my 3rd grader and this is the one!!! It has everything I have been looking for. ""

• ""...This is well worth the $0.99 which is cheaper than a single pack of flashcards...""


This app's core concept was to create a flexible solution that a grade school child can easily navigate and that is robust enough to grow with your child as they grow their math knowledge. 

Overview –
• FLASHCARD mode (practice) – Allows children to practice specific number sets and operators in the proven learning style of flashcards. Watch the flashcards flip like real flashcards!

• CHALLENGE mode (exam) – Lets children test what they have learned by having to type in the answer

• SIMPLE and FLEXIBLE –
    › Simple enough for your child to set and use
    › Flexible - Choose ANY combination of operators and number sets 

• PROFILES - Add unlimited number of profiles to monitor each child's progress

• PROGRESS REPORTS! - Flexible reporting allows you to filter on numerous items to see your child's progress. 
    › EMAIL Progress Reports - Ability to send your results to teachers, parents, or whoever! (Note: An active email account must be setup on the device to use this feature.)

• ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION

• NUMBER SETS - We designed the app to start at a beginner’s level, but the difficulty can be increased by changing the settings. When working on the number sets with the default settings you will only be adding 0-9 to the selected number set or multiplying each number set by 0-9. (with corresponding subtraction and division problems) In settings, you can change the range from 0-9, to 0-12, 0-15, or 0-20. 
    
• SETTINGS menu - 
    › Settings are customizable for each profile.
    › Ability to change the range of numbers from 0-9, to 0-12, 0-15, or 0-20.
    › Ability to select the number of problems to work in Challenge mode
    › Ability to set whether missed problems are repeated
    › Ability to display a timer in Challenge mode


• RESULTS menu – Results screen displays after completing a set:
       › Summary by operator and number set shows the number of items answered right and wrong 
       › Detailed listing of any actual problems missed - Note: When the problems missed are listed, they are shown with what the correct answer should be, not with the incorrect answer typed by the user. This way the user can study the solutions and try to do better next time. 
       › Timed results – Gauge your child's aptitude by reviewing the time to complete a number set. Encourage your child to “beat their time"".

Shell Shock!
★★★★★

★ Thanks to all the version 1 owners!  1.5 is the release I wanted to release as an update to the original Shell Shock game, however I was unable to release it as I had originally intended, so, I've decided to release it as 1.5 as-is until v2 is ready for release.  Shell Shock v2 Will include the full version of Shell Shock v1!

The release notes:
★ 5 all new Levels! Levels 8, 11, 13 are completely new while levels 29 and 30 have been added to the ice planet levels to finish off that collection!

★ Most all levels have been updated with new shading/lighting/efx making the experience of the game levels even more engaging.  Check out the Snow levels!

★  All new UI and controls!  Slide your finger on either side of the screen to increment the angle and power now.  Roll your finger for finer adjustments or use the +/- buttons at the bottom of the screen to fine tune your shots.

★ New HUD!  MUCH improved HUD information displaying level, time, enemy count and shell count.  The bottom HUD shows you angle and power information and provides you fine tuning +/- buttons should you want to adjust those values in that fashion. 

★ New Angle HUD indicator to help see precisely where your barrel is aimed.

★ Changed the way shots were detecting collisions.  Now, it's a pin point accurate shot with even the most challenging terrains!  This has increased the level of difficulty on the Veil of Darkness levels considerably.  Instead of easy arcs, many of the more difficult targets are now truly behind the barriers as I'd originally intended - making the game play on those particular levels much more interesting and a challenge!

★ Removed OpenFeint.  There were several complaints and issues with Open Feint plugin and as a result, it's been removed from the game to eliminate crashes and bugs beyond my control. I will be looking into GameCenter integration in a later release.  Thanks for your patience.

Thank you to all the loyal fans of Shell Shock and your support.  If you have a moment, I would really appreciate a rating/review on this release.  I could really use the support if you feel the game warrants a rating.

Thanks again for your patience as well - I continue to strive to make Shell Shock an enjoyable and engaging game, and your patience and feedback make that possible

★ Shell Shock is the classic ""angle & shoot"" game where the player uses angle and power to fire rockets over obstacles at their targets. Just sit back, have fun and blow stuff up!

★ New types of obstacles have been created for this style of game, taking it to a whole new level!  Moving objects, shielded cannons with rotating shields, and more!

★ Created from the ground up, this version of a the timeless classic arcade game brings a rich visual experience with a powerful set of music scores!  The environments are filled with detail and ambience to enhance this classic game style!

★ Work your way through 30 levels of full 3D environments along with a beautiful sound track and sound efx!

★ Classic Tank Arcade Game Play
★ Easy to use and intuitive controls
★ Rich, Beautiful 3D environments
★ Magnificent explosions!
★ 3 Worlds to explore:  Earth (training), World of Metal, Ice Planet 
★ Realistic physics simulation
★ Powerful sound fx and music score
★ Play with your own music if you like!

Released on March 9, 2011, the New American Bible, Revised Edition (NABRE) is the culmination of nearly 20 years of work by a group of nearly 100 scholars and theologians, including bishops, revisers and editors. The NABRE includes a newly revised translation of the entire Old Testament (including the Book of Psalms) along with the 1986 edition of the New Testament.

The NABRE is a formal equivalent translation of Sacred Scripture, sponsored by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, using the best manuscripts available. Work on most books of the Old Testament by forty revisers and a board of eight editors began in 1994 and was completed in 2001. The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010.

- All the bells and whistles – Universal app, retina display visuals, achievements and leaderboards on Game Center!


Chosen by Apple as Game of the Week!


”Bumpy Road is one of the best purchases I’ve made on the app store. Not just because the gameplay has a hook unlike anything I’ve played on an iOS device, but also because it’s got a fantastic aesthetic.” - IGN.com (9/10 Editor's Choice)

”While Bumpy Road is indeed a solid high scoring game, it’s the peripheral elements that transcend it from being merely a well-made video game to an unforgettable experience ... if you like high scoring games or touching works of art, then you won’t want to miss Bumpy Road ” - Toucharcade.com

""Must Have"" - Slidetoplay.com (4/4)

” ... playing it means feeling love, not love for the designers or the medium or the state of being meaningfully distracted or the sense of communion with everyone who does this or even the game itself, but love. The feeling of love.” - Killscreendaily.com"

Forbidden Island is a cooperative game of strategy and courage as you and up to three other adventurers attempt to capture the four ancient treasures hidden on a sinking island. It's a thrilling adventure based on the best-selling Gamewright board game.

Forbidden Island was the secluded retreat of an ancient mystical empire known as the Archeans. Legend has it that the Archeans possessed the ability to control the Earth's elements - fire, wind, water, and earth - through four sacred treasures: The Crystal of Fire, The Statue of the Wind, The Ocean's Chalice, and The Earth Stone. Because of their potential to cause catastrophic damage if they fell into enemy hands, the Archeans kept the treasures secretly hidden on Forbidden Island and designed it to sink if intruders ever attempted to claim them. In the centuries since the mysterious collapse of their empire, Forbidden Island remained undiscovered ... until now.

Will your team be the first to breach its borders, capture the treasures, and make it out alive?

Awarded as Mensa Select in 2010 and nominated for the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 2011, Forbidden Island is a fantastic game that's fun and engaging for all who play.

经常在1号店上买各种日用品，方便快速，部分商品比超市便宜很多。又有快递小哥送货上门，不需要自己去超市搬饮料、油、米等。真的是居家必备之APP啊

东西放心，优惠也多，比实体超市要好很多。不论是买进口商品还是国内的都比较放心。现在也不是以前那样追求性价比了，更追求质量、服务和售后了，好东西也不值得为了省那点钱买到假货。

★★★★★★★★★★ 
Reviews: 

""Tikal offers jungle brilliance for 10 action points a turn"" - TUAW 

""Deep strategic gameplay... provides a 4-Dimple [out of 5] cerebral experience."" - AppSmile.com 

""Tikal [is] a game I enjoyed my time with and is easily worth the money."" - Gamezebo 

★★★★★★★★★★ 

Send your expedition members out from base camp to discover buried treasure and uncover over-grown temples. But stay alert, as both treasures and temples can change hands as you compete with other expeditions! 

Each turn, you place a new tile representing an area of the jungle you have just mapped, then spend action points to explore. When a volcano tile is revealed, each player has one extra chance to improve their position, then points are awarded. Plan your moves and stake your claims wisely, and your expedition will take it's place in the history books! 

With no setup time required, no pieces to lose, and no arguments about the rules, the future of board games is here and Tikal gives you exactly what you want -- to play! 

How to play:

Choose your favorite of 6 Mayan totems as your avatar, and then discover the true power of this ancient civilization as you compete against them in solo play. 

On a players turn they perform the following actions:

1.Place the next terrain tile on the board; and,
2.Use 10 action points to explore Tikal

Play continues in order with each player placing a new tile and exploring until the volcano tile is drawn. When a volcano tile is drawn players are scored and given 10 more APs to set themselves up for the best possible score.

After the last tile is played a final scoring round occurs and the winner is determined. 

Features 
======== 
No set up required
Fast, easy, and fun game play for 1 to 4 players 
Stunning HD graphics with plenty of eye candy 
Support for 3 modes of play: solo, ""pass and play"", and online multiplayer

Here is how it works...

1. Load a background image.
2. Load a foreground image.
3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.
4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.
5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.
6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.
7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.

You can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.

Masking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.

You can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background."

By using the dialogue exercises, you'll be able to improve both your Italian comprehension and your speaking skills at the same time.

MosaLingua was designed by a Italian professor and a developer who actually uses MosaLingua on a daily basis.

Be sure to check out the video demo on http://mosalingua.com

Did you know that you can get by just fine on vacation knowing less than 500 carefully-chosen words?  Spending just 5 minutes per day for two months will allow you to memorize 600 words and key phrases!

Learn the essential 20% that will apply 80% of the time. Afterwards you can choose an area of focus that is relevant for you (travel, sports, business, technology...). 

Whether you are starting Italian from scratch or you already know the basics, MosaLingua is adapted to suit your language needs. It's like having your own private tutor in your pocket!

Whether your motivation for learning Italian is for school (diploma, class, course, SAT, GCSE), vacation, business purposes or simply for the joy of learning, MosaLingua will have you speaking Italian in no time:

MOSALINGUA CONSISTS OF:
- 3000+ flash cards of vocabulary and phrases, including audio pronunciations by native Italian speakers
- 14 diverse categories (e.g. Accommodation, transportation, shopping, tourism, social, emergencies...)
-more than 100 sub-categories (e.g. At the restaurant, at the hotel, buying and negotiating, sports, partying, flirting...)
- Up to 10 levels to complete, from the basics to more specialized vocabulary
- 17 dialogues presenting common situations that come up on vacation (or when traveling)
- Study Italian lessons and language tips that will aid your progression
- More than 100 bonus materials to unlock as you progress
- Online Italian dictionnary
- Possibility to create your own cards 

LEARN THE ESSENTIAL 20% THAT WILL TAKE YOU 80% OF THE WAY:
Emphasis on the basics in order to understand and be understood
- Learn the most useful/most used vocab (and the most simple) first
- Learn only the most useful phrases for your studies, for your travel, or for Italian SAT or Italian GCSE

HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND PROVEN LEARNING METHOD:
MosaLingua uses the Spaced Repetition System (SRS), the product of several years of scientific research
- Calculates review dates for the flash cards according to how difficult you find each one, to encourage efficient and long term memorization
- Spend time learning what you find useful, not what you already know
- MosaLingua constantly adapts to your needs and pace (like a private teacher)
- Use both audio and visual memory
- Sustained learning (long-term memory)

LEARN ITALIAN ON THE GO
- You get to decide how long each Italian lesson will be (it doesn't matter whether you have only 2 minutes or more than 30 minutes to spend)
- Automatically adapts to your needs and pace
- You can stop a lesson and then pick up where you left off whenever you want
- You don't need an internet connection, all the Italian lesson and content is available OFFLINE

FUN AND ADDICTIVE
- Unlock bonuses as you progress (dialogues, jokes, fun facts, sayings, tips)
- Learn from dialogues based on realistic situations that you may encounter on vacation
- You'll be amazed at how quickly you will learn new Italian words and how addictive it becomes
- the App keeps track of your progress giving you the motivation you need to succeed

Imagine if it was designed so that even a 2 year old could use it, yet detailed enough to entertain an 8 year old.

This version of our popular app will create up to 100 groups, each with typically 100 contacts. (Limits depend on your email provider.)

Create groups in many ways: add from Contacts, import an address book group, enter addresses directly, or paste strings of names and addresses.

MailShot can do several things which regular address book groups cannot...
• Contacts can use different email addresses for each group. (Add work address to a work-related group, and home address to a sports group etc.)
• Contacts do not need to be present in your address book.

TIPS
• Protect privacy by placing addresses in the Bcc: line.
• To forward an email (with attachments), “Copy to clipboard"" then paste to the address line in your Mail app.

Ready, aim, squirt! Join over eight million players in this wet physics puzzler!

""Gaming App of the Day"" - [Kotaku]

""Sprinkle is a solid puzzle game in a similar vein as Crush the Castle or Angry Birds, yet carries gameplay and an identity distinct from either."" 4/4 Must have - [Slide To Play]

""Daily iPhone App"" - [TUAW]

""The game quickly made its way to every member of my family"" - [ArsTechnica]

Using a water cannon mounted on a crane, players must adjust the height and angle of the cannon to fight fires, move obstacles, spin wheels and activate traps in this challenging water-physics based puzzler! But squirt carefully as you will run out of water and the less water you use, the more drops you earn!

Using some of the most realistic water physics seen on an iOS device yet, Sprinkle is a brain-teasing game that will have players straining to figure out each puzzle and obstacle.

Sprinkle features:

Amazing water physics – Some of the most realistic water physics ever seen on an iOS device make Sprinkle an exciting and addictive puzzler.

Brain-teasing puzzles – What starts as simply pointing and spraying to quench each fire becomes much more challenging through the 72 levels, as players must overcome the intricacies of each puzzle before time and water run out.

Blocks, boulders, and cogs oh my – Use the power of your water cannon to move blocks of ice and boulders, spin giant cogs, and depress traps inorder to reach and extinguish every last fire.

The inhabitants of Titan, a moon of Saturn, lived out their days peacefully in their straw hut homes – until space tourists from Earth crashed through Saturn’s rings, bringing a storm of flaming asteroids crashing down on the Titans. To combat the widespread fires threatening their homes, the Titans have built a massive water cannon. And they need you to man it!

—CalorieLab, April 2012

""If you have been struggling to get your buns off the couch and somewhat in shape before the summer hits, training for a 5K is not a bad way to start.

887,21263360,1.99,14,1,4,5,4+,Entertainment,37,4,2,"A waste of technology!? We would prefer to think of “Azuki Wave” as our ultimate physics simulation app.
Compatible with iPad Pro, Supports 3D Touch on iPhone 6s !!

Do you know how the sound effect for ocean waves used in television and cinema is created? In Japan, the traditional method is to use “azuki” beans and a bamboo basket called “zaru”. The sound of azuki beans gently rolling around in a zaru basket is just like the sound of ocean waves.

“Azuki Wave” is an app that reproduces the movement and sound of azuki in a zaru on your iPhone or iPad. Our original physics engine, called “Azuki Simulator”, faithfully computes the movement of each individual azuki bean. Along with it, we also developed our “Azuki Synthesizer” to generate sound that is synchronized with the movement of the azuki. Some might consider it futile to aim for such a high level of realism, but the fact is that this app provides a strangely nice feeling to everyone trying it. Simply rolling the azuki around, touching them, listening to the ocean sounds they create somehow allows you to calm down and has a soothing, refreshing effect.

Try “Azuki Wave” when you can't stand the heat outside, when you really feel like going to the sea but can't, or when you want to take your mind off some irritating thing.

* Not compatible with iPhone 3G, 2nd Generation iPod Touch and older devices.

Main Features:
- Realistic azuki bean movement powered by the “Azuki Simulator”, our original physics engine.
- Powerful “Azuki Synthesizer” which generates ocean waves sounds from the sampled sound of a single azuki bean.
- Smooth computer animation depicting high grade Japan-grown azuki beans.
- Supports device inclination and multi-touch interaction.
- Adjustable amount of azuki beans (3 discrete levels).
- Allows simultaneous background music playback.

*No azukis were harmed in the making of this app (they were however eaten by the staff after being used for sampling)."

+ Photon for iPad is #1 in Utilities in US, UK and top 30 overall app around the world.
+ Photon plays flash videos, games and flash websites.

Appsverse Photon Browser is a powerful new browser specifically designed to enhance your browsing experience on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It is packed with innovative features. Here are just some of them:

1. Flash browsing support
- Photon Browser allows you to play Flash games such as free Facebook games, use Flash apps and watch Flash video inline using its remote cloud browse mode.
- Browse Flash websites that would otherwise not display on the iPhone.
- Play music that streams through a Flash player.
- Read news that require Flash support.
- Press the “Lightning” icon on the bottom right navigation bar when you encounter a Flash website on the iPhone or iPod Touch.
- Combines fast native browsing for normal websites and remote browsing for Flash websites. Switch between the 2 modes using the lightning bolt button (for Flash) or the web globe button (for native browsing).
- Support different mode such as pointer mode for precision that makes your iPhone acts like a mouse pad. Supports touch mode for scrolling and touch/click. Supports drag mode for dragging around game maps.
- Zoom in flash. PLEASE WAIT a second or two for the zoom to update before zooming again on iPhone and iPod touches.
- We support audio. PLEASE MAKE sure your mute switch is not on.

2. Fully featured powerful browser
- Private browsing clears history, cookies and caches upon browser exit.
- Anonymous browsing through our servers.
- Share content via email.
- Brightness control for night time browsing.
- Rotation lock for playing web based games.
- Personalize your browser by choosing from thousands of colors.

3. Others
- Bookmarks support
- Print web pages using AirPrint.
- More innovative features to come

Important notes - PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:
- When you encounter a Flash website, REMEMBER TO CLICK ON the ""Lightning Bolt"" button to enter Flash streaming mode. Otherwise, you will see the standard Adobe message that Flash needs to be installed or upgraded as you are still in the native browser mode. Only by explicitly clicking on the ""Lightning"" button will you then be able to view Flash content.

- If you have a slow Internet connection such as over a slow 3G network, remote browsing feature may have slow performance even though we have made great technological improvements to support Flash over low bandwidth. Flash mode works best over Wifi in a broadband network. Just because you have Wifi does not mean you have a fast network. Wifi is fast enough but your bottleneck is the wired connection that your Wifi sits on. However, you can still use Photon as a fast native browser for your regular browsing.

- If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us given in the support link on iTunes. We are extremely responsive and answer questions within 1-3 business days. For terms, please go to www.appsverse.com/Terms"

KNOTS 3D REVIEWS
----------------------
Superb in every way - 5 Stars!
I'm a fairly handy guy (surgeon) and rely on several knots in my practice. Nevertheless I'm pretty hopeless at learning new knots and remembering them, even though I'm a sailor and do some fishing.  Knots 3D is the answer. I love every aspect of the app.

Great App - 5 Stars!
I really like this app, I have 4 knot apps, and I use this one the most. As a firefighter rope skills is a must and this app helps keep me ""knot prepared"". The zoom and step through the knot using a finger gestures is real handy. The author updates this app with new knots often. I recommend this app.

====================================

■ Great!!! Thank you very much. (^_^) - Version 3.4 - 22-Aug-2012
I started with this app two months ago as I prepared to renew my driver's license this August. I used it three times a day, and imagine my surprise at the result: I got a call back from the exam rep, saying ""You won't need to use your glasses anymore when driving. We're removing any glasses restrictions from your license."" I was astonished! Thank you.

■ Definitely improves vision. - Version 3.4 - 17-Jul-2012
I used the app continuously for three months, every day. I feel like my vision has improved considerably.

■ Works - Version 3.4 - 21-Jul-2012
My aging eyes have improved a bit. I plan to continue the regimen.

■ The best! (^_^) - Version 3.4 - 30-Jul-2012
My sight really improved!! 

============================================

Vision is made up of two components, that of the eyes themselves and that of the brain.
""Eye vision"", what we commonly think of as vision itself, is the ability of the eyes to focus in on the things that they see.
""Brain vision"" is the ability of the brain to take what the eyes have received and perceive that as an image.
In order to restore vision, it is not necessary to only train the physical eyes but the brain as well. 

In 3D Eyesight Recovery, by looking at the 3D stereograms, 
・ Train your brain vision by trying to focus and see the 3D images.
・ Strengthen eye muscles that are not commonly used.
・ Stretch your eyes by using the opposing horizontal and cross viewing methods.
・ Continue using it daily because of the enjoyment that viewing stereograms brings.

Through the use of this application you'll be able to accomplish the above four at once while performing enjoyable exercise for your eyes.

￭ Instructions for Use
Look at the stereogram using the walleyed method and the cross-eyed method, one after the other. Use this app regularly on a daily basis.

※Looking at 3D stereograms is exercise, so your eyes will get tired. Please refrain from using this app for extended periods of time so as not to tire your eyes.

※There is no guarantee that the effect will work on everyone."

Flick your finger and make a homerun.
You can experience a real baseball batting through the physical pendulum. 

This is a game in which you can experience various throws based on the pendulum. The ball will fly further if you can hit the ball directly with the quick flick. Experience a “real-life like” batting simulation. 


■ Easy Control---------------------------
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That’s all.

■ Movement of the ball------------------
Various kinds of throws are materialized into “real-life like” feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

■ 10 GAME mode------------------------
You can enjoy this game through 5 kinds of mode.
Minor & Major Mode- Hit as many home-runs as you can; as far as you can.
Multiplayer Mode- You can compete with other players via Game Center.

-- That is a product of chance we obtained.

- Product Summary
STEINS;GATE is the second collaborative work between 5pb and Nitroplus with a science-fiction/adventure theme.
Released on October 2009 for the Xbox 360, it won the highest Famitsu Award (Japanese video game magazine).

An anime adaptation began airing on April 2011, and it is becoming increasingly popular.
The story found in STEINS;GATE is not your usual time traveling fare, but is a ""hypothetical science adventure"" focused on the structure of time travel itself.
Many of the situations and scientific concepts referred to in the game have been plucked from real science; the story-line is therefore credible and intellectual stimulating for players.

* A suspenseful adventure game based on time travel!
* The story takes place in Akihabara and revolves around science-fiction, touching on subjects such as SERN, John Titor, ""IBN5100"" PC and more!

Coverage Notes: If you live in a very-high-altitude town in Colorado (e.g. Fraser, Vail, Aspen), this app will likely not meet your needs, since radar beams get blocked by the tall mountains. Alaska coverage includes only the southern coastal areas, and does not include the Aleutian Chain. Cloud coverage does not include Alaska and Guam. 

Notes: 
- This app is only useful for users in the US, including all 50 states and territories including Puerto Rico and Guam.

Hello everyone! Are you up to an adventure? I am Abby the Monkey, the friend you know from a highly-successful application series by 22learn, and I have prepared one for you! If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! 

But first let me tell you a story…. 
****************************************** 
Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. 

The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. 

All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! 
****************************************** 

But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! 

And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? 

Thank you for your purchase!"

http://loopyapp.com

-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) 
-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier 
-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer
-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording

Now compatible with Ableton Link, a new technology that synchronises beat, phase and tempo. It works between Ableton Live and Link-enabled iOS apps over a wireless network, or iOS apps on the same device. Just turn it on in Settings to get started! http://ableton.com/link

Compatible with the Audiobus app: Now you can receive live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!

While other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. 

More advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace.

- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.

- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping.

- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. 
- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. 
- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. 

MANIPULATE & TWEAK 

- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. 
- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. 
- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. 
- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. 
- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.

====================
""I'd say the inner circle of [board game] apps would now include Tigris & Euphrates"" 
- ""The dish"" by Keith Law 

""Tigris and Euphrates is exceptional..."" 
- iOS Board Games blog on BoardGameGeek.com 

""Codito is ... giving Days of Wonder a run for their money."" 
- iPadBoardGames.org 
====================

iPhone USERS PLEASE NOTE: 

There is an orientation issue in iOS8 that causes the game to launch as just a black screen. Simply hold your device with the home button on the other side and the app should function normally. We will, of course, try to fix this for a future update! Thanks for your support and your patience!

====================

In fertile Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, lies the cradle of civilization. 

Your goal is to develop all 4 of the key spheres of civilization: Settlements, Temples, Farms, and Markets. To do this, you will position your leaders, create and extend kingdoms, build monuments, and resolve conflicts. Tension arises when kingdoms connect and leaders clash on the board, with only one leader of each type surviving. You will thus aquire victory points in each of the four spheres. The winner is the player who develops their civilization in the most balanced way, without revealing a sphere of weakness. 

With no setup time required, no pieces to lose, and no arguments about the rules, the future of board games is here and Tigris & Euphrates gives you exactly what you want -- to play! 

How to play:

During their turn, the active player may carry out up to two of the following actions, in any order:

- Position (place, move or remove) a leader.
- Place a tile and earn a victory point.
- Place a catastrophe tile.
- Swap up to 6 tiles

The active player may choose two different actions, or the same action twice.

Features 
======== 
No set up required
Support for 3 modes of play: solo, ""pass and play,"" and ""hotseat"" (around the table) play 
Stunning HD graphics for iPad, Retina, and original iPhone/iPod screens 
In-game hints make it easy to learn the game
Tested on iOS 3.1.3 through iOS 5.0 
Play your own iPod music

Note: you must install iOS 5 on your device in order to play T&E online!
